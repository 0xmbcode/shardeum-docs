# What is Shardeum?

Shardeum is the world's first layer 1 blockchain that solves scalability trilemma. Shardeum is an EVM-based, linearly scalable smart contract platform that provides low gas fees forever while maintaining true decentralization and solid security. The network aims to onboard billions of daily users and numerous DApps to Web 3 in the future. Shardeum’s smart contract platforms are deployed in developer and user friendly programming languages - Solidity & Vyper.

Linear scalability was recently demonstrated to a live audience ahead of the project’s alphanet launch aka ‘Shardeum Liberty’. Linear scalability enables Shardeum to increase throughput (TPS) as more nodes join the network through ‘dynamic state sharding’ which will be explained shortly. Linear scalability ensures that the gas fees on the network remain very low forever regardless of how many people use it in the future. Further, it helps the network to scale horizontally and achieve high decentralization at any given point in time.
