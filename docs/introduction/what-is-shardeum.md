# What is Shardeum?

Shardeum is an EVM based L1 that uses dynamic state sharding to achieve linearly scalability. This means Shardeum can increase its TPS capacity with each validator added to the network to retain low fees forever. In many state sharded blockchains, developers face challenges as they don't retain atomic composability across shards. However, Shardeum uses a novel architecture where atomic composability is retained. Shardeum provides the highest throughput capacity of any EVM based L1 without sacrificing on decentralization.

For developers, the experience of building on Shardeum is the same as other EVM chains, you can deploy contracts in Solidity or Vyper and there aren't any special considerations relative to sharding. You don't need to consider which shard you deploy your contract to as the network retains atomic composability with all applications. However, developers benefit from linear scaling on Shardeum as you no longer have to concern losing users due to rising gas fees. On Shardeum you can build truly decentralized applications that aren't limited by throughput bottlenecks.
