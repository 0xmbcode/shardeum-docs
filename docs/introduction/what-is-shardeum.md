# What is Shardeum?

Shardeum is the world's first layer 1 blockchain that truly solves scalability trilemma. It is an EVM based smart contract network that scales linearly with low gas fees forever with an aim to onboard billions of daily users and numerous DApps to Web 3. Shardeum’s smart contract platforms are deployed in developer and user friendly programming languages - Solidity & Vyper.

Linear scalability was recently demonstrated to a live audience ahead of the project’s alphanet launch aka ‘Shardeum Liberty’. Linear scalability enables Shardeum to increase throughput as more nodes join the network through ‘dynamic state sharding’ which will be explained shortly. Linear scalability ensures that the gas fees on the network remain very low forever regardless of how many people use it in the future. Further, it helps the network to scale horizontally and achieve high decentralization at any given point in time.
