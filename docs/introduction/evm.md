## Ethereum Virtual Machine

EVM is short for Ethereum Virtual Machine. Let’s start with Virtual Machines in simple words. The purpose of a virtual machine is to virtualize the version of a host computer or server (like client APIs) and deploy that version on multiple (end user) systems with the help of software programs. VMs over time have made it possible to add and distribute multiple virtual servers across multiple systems/devices through automation. In Web1 and Web2, the software programs are typically installed and maintained by developers in centralized institutions for proprietary use.

Let’s bring the Ethereum network into the mix. With EVM in Web3, open source blockchain  is used to handle virtualization of servers across multiple systems with the help of network protocols. The technology is largely operated and maintained by unrelated nodes on the network resulting in high decentralization. Moreover, EVM was further developed to perform and execute any logical step of a computational function through its ‘smart contract’ with a level of automation that was never seen before.

We now have a state machine that virtualizes servers and interfaces of thousands of applications across multiple systems with an unbelievable level of automation. So, in effect, what you are seeing with EVM is not just a decentralized ledger holding data on accounts and balances as a result of its exposure to secondary markets. It has also demonstrated the capability to hold an entire state data of a ton of scalable applications and other web 3.0 commercial services that sits on top of Ethereum network.

## Shardeum is EVM Compatible

Now if you are one of those Ethereum or Ethereum based developers, please note Shardeum is EVM compatible. You don't need to change your application codes to launch various DApps you are building on Shardeum
Any smart-contract written to run in EVM can be easily ported to Shardeum network
You just need to deploy a smart contract written in Solidity or Viper on Shardeum with a bonus that you will never have to worry about rising gas fees again
