# Transaction Consensus

Shardeum’s unique technology is complemented with a unique consensus algorithm that combines Proof-of-Quorum (PoQ) with Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The consensus algorithms will help secure the network through a trustless collection of votes and staking by validator nodes. Each transaction is processed in the order received before being grouped into blocks/partitions. Consensus on the network is done at the transaction level instead of the block level, allowing a transaction to be processed simultaneously across shards rather than consecutively as with block level consensus.

Transaction level consensus eliminates the complexities needed to ensure atomic processing, otherwise required by block level consensus platforms. This further results in immediate finality and low latency, which prevents network congestion. A detailed explanation of Shardeum’s consensus algorithms will be added to this documentation in the upcoming months.
