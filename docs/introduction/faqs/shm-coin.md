● 15% Team - 3 month cliff then 2 years linear vesting 
● 11% Foundation - unlocked at Token Generation Event (TGE) 
● 5% Ecosystem - unlocked at TGE

## Since the community will completely run Shardeum, should we allocate some % of coin distribution to the community too or the team itself means the community?

The Shardeum network will have a native coin called Shard with a ticker symbol of SHM. The coin will be mined by validator, archive and standby nodes as reward for providing resources to the network. The coin will be used for paying gas fees associated with executing transfer transactions as well as smart contract execution on the Shardeum network. And yes, we will have 5% coin allocated for airdrops to the early community members and note, you can earn SHM when you validate transactions on the network following the protocols and keeping it safe. Most will be able to participate in the node running process as the stake amount + server required to mine coins will be quite low. Validator nodes are auto-rotated to ensure safety and opportunity for standby nodes. Standby nodes also will be joining the network randomly when the network traffic peaks.
