Community is the CEO of Shardeum. Shardeum is home to content creators, designers, digital marketers, technologists, cypherpunks and Web 3.0 enthusiasts. They are in charge of bringing a high level of decentralization to billions of people for a more equitable society in the OCC way.

OCC is short for Open, Collaborative and Community driven approach in the effort to install a truly decentralized network to connect billions of unserved, underserved and ordinary people across the world. It is no different from the initial days of the internet where the only CEO was the community who believed when others around dismissed the idea. And the community would not have found long lasting success if not for the open source architecture of the internet. If it was privatized or commoditized, it could still be successful but not at a scale we see today that has lifted billions out of poverty.

So get started and be an early adopter of the network by joining Shardeum’s global community today via official channels here. You will also get a great opportunity to start collaborating with like minded individuals and contribute towards building the future of the internet.
