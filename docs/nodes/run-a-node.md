# Running a node

## Why run a node?

Running your own node increases:

    -read and write speed to a blockchain
    -decentralization with more network endpoints for users to access

## What is the difference between a node and a validator?

## Node

Nodes can read and write to a blockchain.

## Validator

Validators are nodes that can perform consensus.

## Validating Transactions

Shardeum validators perform consensus on transactions.

Shardeum validators with honest transaction consensus earn SHM.

Shardeum validators with dishonest transaction consensus will have their SHM slashed.
