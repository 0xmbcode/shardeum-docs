# Running a validator

## Why run a validator?

Running your own validator:

    -helps secure the Shardeum network
    -earns SHM from user transaction fees

## Validating Transactions

Shardeum validators perform consensus on transactions.

Shardeum validators with honest transaction consensus earn SHM.

Shardeum validators with dishonest transaction consensus will have their SHM slashed.

## How do I run a validator on Shardeum?

More details on how to run a Shardeum validator will be shared at Shardeum Betanet.
Betanet ETA is February 2nd, 2023.
