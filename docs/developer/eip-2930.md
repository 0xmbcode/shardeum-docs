## What is EIP-2930?

EIP-2930 allows users to define addresses and storage slots for a transaction.

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930

## Why is EIP-2930 important?

Shardeum Liberty 1.4 does not require EIP-2930 because the network is not sharded.
You can optionally use EIP-2930 to save gas on Shardeum Liberty 1.4.

Shardeum Liberty 2.0 requires EIP-2930 in order to communicate with addresses that exist on different shards.
Note: some addresses with the same prefix will be on same shard, so in that scenario EIP-2930 is optional.

## Where is the EIP-2930 data located for a transaction?

The accessList transaction parameter is where the EIP-2930 address and storage slot data goes.

## How do I define an accessList for an EIP-2930 transaction?

Based on the EIP-2930 specification, the general syntax should be:

  -the address [20 bytes]

  -then the storage slots being accessed at that address [32 bytes]

Example:

    [
        [
            "0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae",
            [
                "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003",
                "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007"
            ]
        ],
        [
            "0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413",
            []
        ]
    ]

## When should I use EIP-2930 on Shardeum Liberty 2.0?

## EIP-2930 Optional:

## Transfer SHM on Shardeum Between Wallets

Send an EIP-2930 transaction with an accessList address that has no storage:

https://github.com/MarcusWentz/Web3_Get_Set_Contract_Metamask/blob/main/Scripts/python/ShardeumLegacyEIP2930WalletNoStorage.py)

## Contract (Single Address): SimpleStorage

Contract with storage slot 0 as a uint:

https://github.com/MarcusWentz/Web3_Get_Set_Contract_Metamask/blob/main/Contracts/Store.sol

Send an EIP-2930 transaction with the accessList contract address with the storage slot (0 in this case to change the contract state):

https://github.com/MarcusWentz/Web3_Get_Set_Contract_Metamask/blob/main/Scripts/python/ShardeumLegacyEIP2930ContractStorage.py

## EIP-2930 Required:

## Contract: Multicall

Multicall can call other contracts:

https://github.com/MarcusWentz/Web3_Get_Set_Contract_Metamask/blob/main/Contracts/MultiCall.sol

Multicall multiple accessList addresses with different storage slots:

https://github.com/MarcusWentz/Web3_Get_Set_Contract_Metamask/blob/main/Scripts/python/ShardeumContractEIP2930MulticallContracts.py
